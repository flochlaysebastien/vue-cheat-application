# Vue.js quick cheat application
A practical quick cheat application example

## Visual Studio Code
This example is developped on Visual Studio Code IDE (but you can use your favorite IDE). If, like me, you want to use Visual Studio Code, I recommend to install these following extensions :
* Live Server
* Vetur
* Vue 2 Snippets

## Chrome
Chrome offer you the possibility to install the 'Vue.js devtools' extension, which is in my opinion totally essential.
